The third file contains monthly and annual climate data from weather station at Pawhuska, Oklahoma (36.67 N, -96.35 W, Elevation of 255 m) near Osage.Dynamics of above- and below-ground plant biomass were monitored by harvest technique at roughly 2-week intervals during the growing season for the years 1970-1972. Data on above-ground live biomass, standing dead matter, and litter are available for two replications each at recently grazed and an \"ungrazed\" (relatively undisturbed) grassland sites at Osage. Below-ground biomass was sampled at 0-30 cm and 0-90 cm depths. The data were collected as part of a coordinated study over 1-3 years at ten grassland sites of the central and western United States, under the US Grassland Biome Project of the International Biological Program (IBP).
