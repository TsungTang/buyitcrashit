Three data files provide net primary productivity (NPP) estimates for a tropical dry deciduous forest within the 3,300-ha Chamela Biological Station, Mexico. There is one file for each of the three permanent watershed plots located along an elevational gradient from 60 to 160-m above sea level. NPP was estimated from field measurements obtained during wet and dry seasons between 1982 and 1995. A fourth NPP data file provides average nutrient fluxes into and out of five watersheds. The fifth file provides precipitation and minimum/maximum temperature data from measurements obtained onsite. Detailed data are available for above-ground NPP (ANPP) (fine litterfall, wood increment, and leaf herbivory plus an estimation of understory production), and below-ground NPP (BNPP) (fine root production and root increment). Biomass data and nutrient inputs/outputs (P, K, Ca, Mg) averaged from five watersheds are also included in the data set. Estimated ANPP ranged from 611 to 808 g/m2/year between the three sub-sites (average 682 g/m2/year), and total NPP ranged from 1,119 to 1,353 g/m2/year (average 1,206 g/m2/year). These estimates are thought to represent the lower bounds of NPP because root and stem herbivory have not been taken into account, although leaf herbivory is included. Revision Notes: Only the documentation for this data set has been modified. The data files have been checked for accuracy and are identical to those originally published in 2001.
