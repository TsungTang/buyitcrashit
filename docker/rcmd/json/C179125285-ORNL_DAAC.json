The data were used by North American Carbon Program (NACP) Site-Level Synthesis as model driver data and for assessing how well 24 Terrestrial Biosphere Models simulated carbon processes across vegetation types and environmental conditions.*The meteorology data include eight variables: air temperature (K), specific humidity (kg/kg), wind speed (m/s), precipitation (kg/m2/s), surface pressure (Pa), surface incident shortwave radiation (W/m2), surface incident longwave radiation (W/m2), and CO2 concentration (ppm). Gap-filled data were used by modeling teams as input model driver data.*Measured fluxes of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and derived gross primary productivity (GPP) and respiration (R) and respective calculated uncertainty estimates are provided for each tower site at the native time resolution of the observations (30 or 60-minute) as well as the diurnal, seasonal, and annual time scales.
