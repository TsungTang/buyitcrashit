One file contains bi-weekly measurements of above-ground live biomass recorded during the growing season (early May to early October) from 1980 through 1989 on a cold desert steppe at the Inner Mongolia Grassland Research Station of the Chinese Academy of Sciences within the Xilingol Biosphere Reserve. The second file contains monthly and annual climate data recorded at the study site from 1978 through 1989. The study site contains grassland steppes of Leymus chinense and Stipa grandis which are the dominant vegetation types, respectively, in the Eastern Eurasian steppe zone (semi-arid and sub-humid) and the middle Eurasian steppe zone (semi-arid). Both steppes provide good livestock forage and are used mainly as natural grazing lands. Above-ground net primary production (ANPP) was estimated by summing peak live biomass of each of 5 species categories. Peak live biomass of L. chinense steppe occurred between late July and late August and averaged 182.68 g/m2 between 1980 and 1988 while that of S. grandis steppe occurred in mid August to early September and averaged 144.43 g/m2 over the same time period. Mean ANPP for L. chinense steppe during 1980-1989 was 248.63 g/m2/yr. ANPP for S. grandis steppe was not calculated.
