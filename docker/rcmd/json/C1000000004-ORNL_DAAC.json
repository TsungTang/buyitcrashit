Measurements of above-ground live biomass and total dead matter were made by harvesting 0.25-m2 quadrats in the 20 x 20-m study area at eight to ten week intervals from March 1972 to April 1973. Precipitation amount and minimum/maximum temperature were recorded from 1969 through 1993.Above-ground net primary production (ANPP) was estimated by several methods: 332 g/m2/year (annual increase in living biomass, sum of species); 355 g/m2/year (peak or maximum live biomass, plant dry matter weight); 773 g/m2/year (maximum live + dead biomass); 310 g/m2/year (annual increase in living biomass carbon by summing positive increments in biomass); and 691 g/m2/year (annual net production accounting for leaf turnover). The carbon content of ANPP (accounting for leaf turnover) was estimated to be 310 gC/m2/year using a conversion factor of 0.45. Below-ground production was not measured.Revision Notes: Only the documentation for this data set has been modified.
