The experimental forest was established in 1963 by planting 4-year-old P. abies seedlings after clear-felling, burning, and soil scarification. A yield optimization study was started in 1986 to compare the productivity of the boreal forest under four types of treatment (only the results of fertilization/irrigation and no treatment are presented herein). Treatments began in 1987 and continued through the 1996 growing season. Field measurements were made by inventory and harvest methods. After three years of treatment, height and diameter growth in the fertilized/irrigated stands were double that of the control stand. After 10 years, volume growth of fertilized/irrigated stands were almost four times that of the control.
