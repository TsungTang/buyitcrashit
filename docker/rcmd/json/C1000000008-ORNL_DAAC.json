The study areas had been protected from grazing since 1976.Above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) was estimated at 155 g/m2/year (average for the three steppes, based on peak above-ground living biomass). Peak live below-ground biomass was used to estimate below-ground net primary productivity (BNPP): 968 g/m2/year for the F. sibiricum steppe; 983 g/m2/year the Stipa baicalensis steppe; and 1,022 g/m2/year for the L. chinense steppe. Above- and below-ground biomass data were compared with simulation results from the CENTURY model. Simulated data agreed reasonably well with the observed data (within +25%).
